  "summary": "<p><b>Making History</b> follows three friends from two different centuries as they try to balance the thrill of time travel with the mundane concerns of their present-day lives. Two shows in one, it's both a rollicking historical adventure, and a contemporary comedy about love, friendship and trying to fit in to an increasingly complex and impersonal world.</p><p>Dan Chambers, a computer science professor at a small Massachusetts college, recently discovered time travel and has been transporting himself back to the 1700s to spend time with the colonial woman he's fallen for. In the present, Dan is an unpopular nerd. But by claiming song lyrics, lines from movies and stand-up bits as his own in the 18th century, he's absolutely hilarious - he gets the girl and makes friends. But Dan's actions in the past are messing up the present. That woman he's dating is not just any woman. She's Paul Revere's daughter, Deborah, and Dan's meddling in the past causes her father to delay his famous ride, which may have altered the outcome of the entire American Revolution. To set matters right, Dan enlists the help of his colleague, Chris Parish, a brilliant, polished and popular history professor, who's now given the incredible opportunity to actually live the history he teaches. Can Dan, Chris and Deborah save America as we know it? Can a woman from 1775 adapt to life in 2016? Can the three intrepid time travelers improve the past, help the helpless, fight for justice and get rich?</p>",

It all adds up to a complete rethinking of the sheer scale and sophistication of one of the world's most mysterious ancient civilisations.</p>",

Filmed on battlefields across the world, this new original series puts viewers in the heat of the battles, witnessing historic armored combats through the eyes of the very men who manned the tanks and fought to the finish. Greatest Tank Battles brings the full fury of mechanized warfare to the screen for the first time by analyzing the weapons, defenses, tactics and using ultra-realistic CGI animation. The viewer experiences the complete picture of tank warfare: a General's-eye view of the battlefield, a soldier's-eye view of face to face confrontations and meticulous technical analysis by military historians. From the mighty 88mm cannon of the Second World War German Tiger to the thermal imaging target system of the Gulf War M-1 Abrams - the series examines the significant technical details that shaped a century of battle. Greatest Tank Battles will for the first time take viewers through the hatch and inside some of history's most legendary tanks, allowing them to see the battle through the eyes of tank commanders and their crews. They'll ride along with some of some of the greatest tank aces, discovering how they were able to make kill after kill, often against overwhelming odds, and escape with their lives. Their stories bring to life epic conflicts such as those on the Eastern Front where 100,000 tanks clashed in history's biggest war. But some stories push ever farther afield to bring eyewitness accounts of pivotal tank battles in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East. Greatest Tank Battles takes us deeper into the mechanized battlefield than ever before revealing the delicate balance between man and machine - between victory and death- it puts viewers in the commander's seat and sends them into the heart of the action.</p>",
